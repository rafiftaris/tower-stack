## Note

I can't create an everlasting pendulum because of the calculation difference between platform (mobile/desktop)
so I added time limit for the block drop. There's also a bug in recycling blocks so object pooling
can't be implemented. Therefore, the highest score that can be achieved is 1000. Item generator is
also disabled because it is not compatible with the current mechanics.
